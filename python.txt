Hello sir.
This is Nam Nguyen from Vietnam Hanoi, who has worked as a Senior Blockchain Developer over 6 years.
I have developed several Dapps like NFT marketplace and Crypto Arbitrage bot like hassonline, many Blockchain integrated project like http://meccareira.com.
About the Crypto Arbitrage Bot platform development I have worked for the hassonline project so I have extensive and well-fit experience for your requirement.
For like this platform, I can use the bitquery.io API to monitor the token price like ERC-20 real time and to send an alert to platform subscribers when it
reaches or exceeds a certain range. It will provides the more convenient function for subscribers to easily monitor the token price information they want at all
times.The most common strategy of trading bots is to dominate real-time token prices on internationally recognized online cryptocurrency service platforms
such as Binance, Coinbase, OKEX, Pancakeswap, and Uniswap V2, and sell tokens purchased at low prices at high prices on other platforms to gain profit.
By the way I can developed the Front-end part with React or Vue based on the Figma Design.

Here is the reference figma design for your platform I have made for my favourites on last January.
https://www.figma.com/file/aoLgA6Gs9im2xdCC3oL0Sn/arbitrage-trading-platform-(June-1%2C-2024)?type=design&node-id=904-3485&mode=design&t=rqrhmySeUUOgWxVW-0
For the Back-end Part will be made with Node.js & Express.js and will use the MongoDB for the Database.
I have to integrate the Market Monitoring features to the platform and Identifying the Arbitrage Opportunites.
Most important thing is Strategy Implementation.
Every Bot Platforms have their own strategies and the success of the project depends on this.
To implement this stragtegy, I have to consider several features like Calculating Profits and Risks, arbitrage trades, such as market volatility,
latency issues, and exchange withdrawal limitations, Risk Management, Trade Execution , Monitoring and Adjustments , Backtesting and Optimization,
Compliance and Regulation, Security, Monitoring and Reporting.

If you assigned me your project. I will do my best to make it succesfully and will share more infos like hassonline strategies.
I am sure it will be the great reference for your project.

I will look forward to hearing good news from you.
Thanks for your time.

Convert 32-bit MFC / C++ app to 64 bits
Desktop Software Development Posted Jun 1, 2023
I have 2D animation app (digicel.net) that was very popular in its day. The studios used it to make RugRats Go Wild, Looney Tunes Back in Action, The Simpsons Movie and many others.

We were adding new features and converting to 64-bit but my programmer retired before it was finished.

Now I need someone to finish the conversion and then probably debug some of the new features. When that's done I’d also like to give it a face lift and continue to add new features.

This could take as much time as possible to start with and then become a long term part time job after that.

If this sounds interesting to you and you are good with MFC and C++ please get in touch.
